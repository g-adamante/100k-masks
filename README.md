# Máscaras do Bem Campaign Website

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a website for the "Máscaras do Bem" campaign. Our goal was to rally support and raise donations, and we successfully gathered over 30,000 masks.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Simple website showcasing the objectives of the campaign and the progress in mask donations.
- **Backend Integration with Google Sheets**: Developed a mini-backend that leverages Google Sheets, allowing for simple and immediate updates on donation figures.
